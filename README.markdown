# Where My Stitches At?

This is a simple Javascript-driven site to keep track of your current row while working on a crochet or knit project. 

## Usage

* Left-click increments your row
* Right-click decrements your row
* Spacebar resets to 1

This site utilizes a single cookie to remember what row you are on for subsequent visits.

## TODO

* Add a help screen to the main page
* Make a mobile version for the iPhone and handle swiping gestures
